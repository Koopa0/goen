// TestThePageMarksTheCategoryYouAreIn holds a field that was read and never written.
//
// layouts.Page.Nav decides which top-level category the header marks as current —
// the is-active class and, more importantly, aria-current="page". It was declared
// with the header, read on every render, and assigned by NOTHING: no navigation item
// had ever been highlighted, and a screen reader was never told where the visitor
// was.
//
// That is layouts.Page.CartCount exactly, in the same struct, three fields down. The
// fix follows the same rule: it is set where the page's chrome is BUILT, not by each
// handler, because a field every caller must remember to fill is a field that goes
// unfilled.

// TestAComparisonCanBeBuiltFromAListing holds the one path into /compare.
//
// The comparison lives in the URL and nowhere else, which is what makes it
// shareable and correct under the back button. That also means every link into
// it has to carry the set — and none did. The PDP's button appended the product
// it was on to whatever the PDP's own URL already held, /compare's table linked
// each column back to a bare /p/{slug}, and the too-few empty state pointed at
// the home page. So a shopper could reach /compare with exactly ONE product,
// forever: a feature with a decision record, a localized spec table and a lock
// of its own, that nothing on the site could produce a second column for.
//
// The listing is where somebody chooses between candidates, so the listing is
// where the set is built. A GET form, because a comparison writes nothing.
